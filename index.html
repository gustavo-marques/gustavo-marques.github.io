			I am a Project Scientist at the <a href="https://ncar.ucar.edu/" rel="external">National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)</a> working in the Oceanographic Section of the <a href="https://www2.cgd.ucar.edu/" rel="external">Climate & Global Dynamics (CGD) division</a>. I am part of the team that is coupling <a href="https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/MOM6">MOM6</a>, an open-source ocean model maintained by the <a href="https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/" rel="external">Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory </a>, to the <a href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/" rel="external"> Community Earth System Model </a> (CESM). Once this is accomplished, I will serve as the community liaison for the <a href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/working_groups/Ocean/" rel="external"> Ocean Model Working Group</a> of CESM.

	                My research is focused on understanding physical processes controlling the ocean circulation around Antarctica. I am particularly interested in the role that these processes play in regulating the melting of ice shelves and the formation and export of bottom water. I approach these problems by relying on idealized and realistic numerical model simulations that are constrained by observations and theory.
